## Introduction

In today's lecture, we will discuss about building a CLI in Python.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install the packages in the `Pipfile` into the pipenv virtual environment.

2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.

3. We will be running `python lib/cli.py` to run the code in our `cli.py` file.
